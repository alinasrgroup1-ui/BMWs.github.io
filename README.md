# BW — Black & White Portfolio

A minimal, accessible single-page portfolio focused on a high-contrast black-and-white aesthetic.

## Features
- Responsive grid gallery
- Accessible semantic HTML
- Theme toggle (persists with localStorage)
- Smooth internal navigation
- Lightweight, framework-free: HTML, CSS, JS only

## Quick start
1. Create a new GitHub repository and add these files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`.
2. Commit and push to `main`.
3. In the repo Settings → Pages, set Branch to `main` and Folder to `/ (root)` then Save.
4. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Customization tips
- Replace placeholder images with high-resolution monochrome photos.
- Add project detail pages and link from each card.
- Use automatic image optimization services or pre-generate 2:1 crops for consistent layout.
- To collect real messages, connect the form to a serverless endpoint (Netlify functions, GitHub Actions, or any backend).
